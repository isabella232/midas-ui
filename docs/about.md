## ReactJS template project

This project is to jumpstart you and your team when building a ReactJS frontend that communicates with a backend server API. It is our intent that a team will be able to fork this repo and push it to their P1 Group. By the end of the day a team should be able to push have a hello world instance of this app that is passing all P1 pipelines and deployed in staging. Ensuring the team deals less with configuring a new project and is instead able to focus more on building and delivering features for users.

* Material-ui components and theme
* Redux state management (actions, selectors, & reducers)
